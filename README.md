# Does Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm solve Portfolion Optimisation ?
The [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06497) has shown that using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms in particular, the DDPO method can nearly find the optimal strategy for well-known portfolio optimisation problems.

In this work, we aim to apply different DRL algorithms, such as [Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/haarnoja18b/haarnoja18b.pdf) and [Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347), to investigate whether certain types of DRL algorithms are better suited for portfolio optimisation tasks.
